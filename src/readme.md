## lifecycle

The life cycle of the player is composed of three stage:

The setup stage, where we create and setup the canvas and preload neccessary media.
Then we run the sequence.
Finally we dispose of the canvas and defer control to the runner (probably [minno-manager](https://github.com/minnojs/minno-quest)).
